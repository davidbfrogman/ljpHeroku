					It really depends on what you're looking for.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>What is the Non-refundable reservation fee for?</strong>
					<br /> It acts as a force field, some sort of protection and assurance that both yours and the photographer’s time and effort
					won’t be put to waste.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Why should I shoot with you?</strong>
					<br /> Simple: because you deserve it. You're amazing, and I know I can put together some amazing shots for you.
				</p>

				<p>

					<br /> I deliver my proofs within 1-3 days.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>How long should I wait before I get my photos?</strong>
					<br /> It depends. Could be within 2 weeks to 4 weeks. Some shoots require more post processing (photoshop) than others do.
					I can easily give you an estimate when we're shooting.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Will I be able to print my photos?</strong>
					<br /> With most shoots I will send you high resolution images. These will allow you to print them, usually up to an 8x10.

					<br /> Who doesn’t want to look and feel their best during shoots? A professional Make-up artist and hairstylist can help
					you achieve that. These industry professionals from my network enhance your natural beauty and make you stand out at
					your photos! Trust me they know how to make you look fantastic.  And to be honest there's a pretty big difference
					between what looks best for a night out on the town, and what's going to look best when you're in front of some studio lights.

					<br /> Not a problem at all. I have a studio and we can rent a bigger studio if you require a bigger space.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>How do I know which clothes to wear?</strong>
					<br /> First think of the output that you want to achieve form your session. What will be the use of your photos? Next, check
					your wardrobe and see whatever it is that is comfortable that you love to wear. Bring it, along with some solid colored
					shirts, a jacket/blazer. We could talk about your wardrobe upon our meeting/consultation. Also, If you want, I can refer
					you to my network of stylists who could turn your wardrobe dilemma to a piece of cake.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>Can I bring someone during the shoot?</strong>
					<br /> Yes, as long as you don’t bring your entire family it should be fine. Keep in mind my studio isn't huge, and there's
					not a lot of room to sit and relax.
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>I have more specific questions that you left unanswered. Where and how can I reach you?</strong>
					<br /> Feel free to <a href="/contact" rel="nofollow">contact</a> me and we can get working on your shoot.

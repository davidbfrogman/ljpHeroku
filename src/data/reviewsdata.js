I will admit, I was super nervous getting in front of a camera(I\'m a musician, not a model) so of course I was feeling self-conscious, but Dave was super honest with me about posing(highly appreciated), he told me what sorts of poses look best, but most importantly he let me be myself, and I absolutely fell in love with the photos he took.'

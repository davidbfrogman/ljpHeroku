    Photography started for me nearly the day I was born. You see, my father is a photographer and

literally photographed m birthing. A bit graphic, but my relationship with a camera began early.

Growing up I would spend time with my father in the dark room processing film and making

prints. I knew the ins and outs of the darkroom. My father made it a point to document every moment

of my life. Dance recitals, Halloween costumes, opening presents on Christmas, class photos at my

elementary school, etc. Even though my father was a nature and landscape photographer, that didn’t

mean he didn’t have his camera with him always. He used claim that the reason he always had his

camera was, “You just never know when you might see Bigfoot”. Anyway, I think the being

photographed nearly every day of my life as a child has given me both a certain awareness of the

camera and an innate ability to pose models. I’m very lucky in that regard.

Fast forward some years and I think I can find where my interest in fashion photography was

spawned. In both middle school and high school I would often play make believe, in a way, with the

point-and- shoot my father gave me. I remember pulling lamps from all over the house for “lighting” –

my mom hated this. I would dress up my friends and do their hair and makeup and make pretend that it

was a real photo shoot. Of course, the photos weren’t actually great, but it was something I loved to do

for fun. I think that’s where it really started, however, it would take much longer for me to realize.

I started off college going to school for musical theater. It wouldn’t be long until I enrolled at the

Art Institute of Colorado in the commercial photography bachelors program. I took classes in many

fields: architectural photography, portraiture photography, advertising photography, and some more

classes. None of it stuck though. After a year of pursuing a photography degree I left and changed

majors again. It would be after 5 more years that I would finally revisit.

I finally learned what I was meant to do by luck, almost. A friend and I were watching an episode

of America’s Next Top Model and decided to have a pretend photo shoot, as per usual. Mind you I had

worked as a photographer off and on after the Art Institute for extra cash. Mostly family portraiture,

senior portraits, and weddings. I didn’t like it though. Anyway, we did a little fashion shoot and it finally

made me realize I wanted to go back to school.

With a newly focused perspective I enrolled in the Art Institute of Colorado for the second time

with a clear vision of becoming a fashion photographer. I did really well, too! It’s amazing to see what

clarity can do for school, when you know exactly where and what you want to be. During school I

excelled and even won the Photo District News student fashion photography competition. I started to

get published in magazine and book clients at year two of my four years. I was hungry and loved every

minute I was shooting clothes.

Since then I’ve shot for a number of fashion magazines including QVEST, Jute Magazine,

Ellements Magazine, Lucy’s Magazine, Imute magazine, and many more! I’ve also worked in the

commercial photography field for clients such as Northface and Cochlear Implants. I’ve shoot fashion

look books for Aspen True, Love That Lingers, and more. I’ve even done advertising photography for The

Buffalo Exchange and a number of hair salons. And beauty photography for NAHA and a 303 Awards.

I’ve been fulfilled in my career and am so happy working in the fashion industry, but I felt like I

outgrew my hometown Denver. So, I’ve recently moved to the Czech Republic and now live in Prague.

Being a fasion photographer in Prague is an exciting new prospect, and I hope I will do well in Prague.

Prague is certainly beautiful, and to be a successful Prague fashion photographer would be a dream

come true. I can’t wait to see what Prague and the Prague fashion industry holds for me. It’s a very

exciting time in my life.

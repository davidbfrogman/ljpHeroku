                <p>
                    Photography has been a deep-rooted pursuit for me. My father is a nature and landscape photographer, which meant I grew up
                    in a darkroom processing film and making prints. In my youth, I spent time doing make-pretend photo shoots, which often meant
                    pulling lamps from all over the house for lighting and dressing my friends up all to take tiny polaroids on my camera. However,
                    it took me a long time in my life to figure out it was more than fun and I finally enrolled in photography school. The rest
                    is history. 
               </p>
               <p>     
                    Fashion is like water for me. I probably consume more fashion in a day than I drink water, and I drink A LOT of
                    water. Being able to create a story with clothes and the personality behind a subject is everything to me. Story-telling
                    is what it’s all about, which has also bore my love for portraiture. Creating a photo is the most fulfilling piece of my
                    life. That and my husband.

                    So please, take a look at my portfolio and contact me if you feel the way I do. I would love
                    to create something with you! I am also the owner and Editor-in-Chief of Jute Magazine, which you can see

                            with all the modeling agencies here in Prague for years, so I know what they look for, and can help guide you towards the perfect portfolio images.

                <p>
                    I've been a photographer for almost as long as I can remember, and I come by it honestly too.  You know those halmark cards from the 1970's?  The still lifes 
                    with the soft focus.  Well most likely if you've seen one of those shots you saw a shot taken by my grandmother.  She's a lot of the reason I'm doing
                    what I do.  She gave me my first camera when I was just a kid.  Ever since then I've been in love with photography.  Early on I knew I loved taking 
                    pictures of people.  They were by far my favorite subject.  I'm not quite sure why, but people are fascinating to me.  I love being able to capture
                    that once in a lifetime expression, or moment.  I would say in a lot of ways I'm a simple portrait artist at heart, but I've moved more into fashion
                    because it allows me to be as creative as I want to.  I'm constantly coming up with new directions I want to take my my lighting or retouching in.  It's
                    great to have the kind of freedom that fashion photography allows me. I really would love to work with you to come up with your perfect 
                    vision.
